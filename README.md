<p>
FinTech Solutions Inc. is a financial technology company that provides digital payment and transaction services to both individual customers and businesses. 
As the company expanded its digital offerings, transaction volumes increased steadily, which also raised exposure to fraudulent activity and the need for 
stronger, more proactive fraud monitoring processes.
</p>

<p>
This analysis was conducted using two years of historical data (2023–2024), covering approximately <strong>2,000 customers</strong> and 
<strong>49,924 transactions</strong>. The dataset consisted of two primary tables: a <strong>Customer Profile table</strong>, which contained customer 
and account-level information, and a <strong>Transaction table</strong>, which captured detailed transaction activity across merchant categories, 
locations, and time periods.
</p>

<p>
From a fraud data analyst’s perspective, this dataset made it possible to understand how customers typically transact over time, identify meaningful 
changes in behavior, and flag transactions that deviated from expected patterns. The objective was not to label transactions as confirmed fraud, 
but to proactively highlight high-risk activity that required further review. This approach supports faster investigations, reduces potential customer 
impact, and strengthens the organization’s overall fraud monitoring capability.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Customer Behavior Profiling:</strong> Customer transaction histories were analyzed to establish what “normal” behavior looks like for each account. 
This included transaction frequency, typical spending ranges, preferred merchant categories, and usual transaction locations. Building this behavioral 
context made it easier to identify customers whose activity suddenly deviated from historical patterns, which is often an early indicator of potential 
fraud or account misuse.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Transaction Anomaly Detection:</strong> Transactions were reviewed for patterns commonly associated with elevated fraud risk, such as unusually 
large transaction amounts, cross-state activity that differed from a customer’s registered location, and abnormal transaction timing. These anomalies 
helped surface transactions that stood out from expected behavior and required closer attention from the fraud or compliance team.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Rule-Based Fraud Scoring:</strong> Business-driven fraud rules were applied to convert suspicious behavior into measurable risk signals. 
Each transaction was evaluated against predefined conditions, and a fraud score was assigned based on the number of risk indicators triggered. 
This scoring approach enabled consistent classification of transactions into Medium- and High-Risk categories, allowing investigative efforts 
to be prioritized more effectively.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Fraud Alert and Investigative Support:</strong> The final output of the analysis was a structured fraud alert table that consolidated transaction 
details, customer context, rule hits, and assigned risk levels into a single view. This structure supports faster case review, clearer prioritization 
of high-risk alerts, and smoother hand-off to investigation or compliance teams, aligning closely with real-world fraud monitoring workflows.
