  <h2>1. Client Background</h2>
  <p><strong>Client:</strong> FinTech Solutions Inc.</p>
  <p>
    FinTech Solutions Inc. is a U.S.-based fintech that provides digital payment and
    card transaction services across multiple states. As transaction volumes grew
    and customer accounts diversified, the company needed a clearer way to spot
    transactions that could indicate fraud.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the company had large volumes of transaction and customer data, there
    was no consistent process to turn that data into <strong>actionable fraud alerts</strong>
    for investigators and compliance teams. The goal was to build a system that
    proactively flags high-risk activity and supports <strong>Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transaction details:</strong> amount, timestamp, merchant category, location</li>
    <li><strong>Customer attributes:</strong> income band, card type, registered state, account tenure</li>
    <li><strong>Time coverage:</strong> 2023–2024</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Stakeholders</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fraud &amp; Compliance Teams</li>
    <li>Business Operations</li>
  </ul>

<h2>2. Business Problem & Project Aim</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
FinTech Solutions Inc. wanted to <strong>proactively detect suspicious transactions</strong> before they impacted customers or eroded trust. 
With increasing transaction volumes and more diverse customer accounts, it became harder for the fraud team to identify high-risk activity quickly.
</p>
<p>
Although transaction and customer data were available, there was <strong>no structured system to flag potentially fraudulent transactions in a timely manner</strong>. 
This made it challenging to prevent customer frustration, potential financial losses, or compliance issues.
</p>

<h3>Project Aim</h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to <strong>develop a fraud alert system</strong> that:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Identifies high-risk transactions</strong> before they impact customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Assigns risk levels</strong> based on multiple fraud detection rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Generates a fraud alert table</strong> that mirrors potentially fraudulent transactions for further investigations.</li>
    <li><strong>Supports regulatory compliance</strong>, including generating Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
By flagging potentially fraudulent transactions early and creating a structured alert for investigation, the system helps 
<strong>protect customers, reduce financial risk, and strengthen internal fraud monitoring processes</strong>.
