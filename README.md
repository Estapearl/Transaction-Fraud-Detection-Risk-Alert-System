  <h2>Background about the Company</h2>
<p>
FinTech Solutions Inc. is a digital payments company that has operated for over eight years, serving retail customers, SMEs, and online merchants across multiple regions. 
The business processes high volumes of daily transactions, including fund transfers, bill payments, cross-border payments, and digital wallet activity.
</p>
<p>
As part of the fraud analytics function, my responsibility was to evaluate customer behavior and transaction patterns to help the company reduce fraud exposure, 
improve early-warning detection, and support compliance requirements. The organization needed deeper, data-driven visibility into suspicious activities 
as transaction volumes grew and fraud attempts became more sophisticated.
</p>
<p>
This portfolio project demonstrates how data-driven fraud monitoring can support operational decision-making and protect both customers and business assets.
</p>

<h2>Insights and Recommendations</h2>
<p>Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:</p>

<h3>1. Customer Behavior Profiling</h3>
<p>
Identifying normal customer behavior patterns — including transaction frequency, value ranges, preferred channels, and historical activity — 
to highlight accounts that begin operating outside expected behavior. 
This helps isolate customers at higher risk of fraud manipulation or account takeover.
</p>

<h3>2. Transaction Anomaly Detection</h3>
<p>
Examining sudden spikes, cross-border activity, new beneficiaries, device changes, and high-value transfers to detect early signs of suspicious activity. 
This provides proactive visibility into scenarios that typically precede fraudulent withdrawals or unauthorized use.
</p>

<h3>3. Rule-Based Fraud Scoring</h3>
<p>
Designing and applying fraud detection rules that automatically assign a risk score to each transaction. 
The scoring logic considers behavioral deviations, unusual patterns, and business-defined thresholds to classify transactions as Medium or High Risk.
</p>

<h3>4. Fraud Alert & Investigative Insight</h3>
<p>
Creating a structured fraud alert output that enables compliance and fraud teams to quickly review suspicious transactions, validate their legitimacy, 
and prioritize cases for investigation. This supports faster decision-making and improves the organization’s fraud-risk posture.

  <h2>1. Client Background</h2>
  <p><strong>Client:</strong> FinTech Solutions Inc.</p>
  <p>
    FinTech Solutions Inc. is a U.S.-based fintech that provides digital payment and
    card transaction services across multiple states. As transaction volumes grew
    and customer accounts diversified, the company needed a clearer way to spot
    transactions that could indicate fraud.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the company had large volumes of transaction and customer data, there
    was no consistent process to turn that data into <strong>actionable fraud alerts</strong>
    for investigators and compliance teams. The goal was to build a system that
    proactively flags high-risk activity and supports <strong>Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transaction details:</strong> amount, timestamp, merchant category, location</li>
    <li><strong>Customer attributes:</strong> income band, card type, registered state, account tenure</li>
    <li><strong>Time coverage:</strong> 2023–2024</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Stakeholders</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fraud &amp; Compliance Teams</li>
    <li>Business Operations</li>
  </ul>

<h2>2. Business Problem & Project Aim</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
FinTech Solutions Inc. wanted to <strong>proactively detect suspicious transactions</strong> before they impacted customers or eroded trust. 
With increasing transaction volumes and more diverse customer accounts, it became harder for the fraud team to identify high-risk activity quickly.
</p>
<p>
Although transaction and customer data were available, there was <strong>no structured system to flag potentially fraudulent transactions in a timely manner</strong>. 
This made it challenging to prevent customer frustration, potential financial losses, or compliance issues.
</p>

<h3>Project Aim</h3>
<p>The goal of this project was to <strong>develop a fraud alert system</strong> that:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Identifies high-risk transactions</strong> before they impact customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Assigns risk levels</strong> based on multiple fraud detection rules.</li>
    <li><strong>Generates a fraud alert table</strong> that mirrors potentially fraudulent transactions for further investigations.</li>
    <li><strong>Supports regulatory compliance</strong>, including generating Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
By flagging potentially fraudulent transactions early and creating a structured alert for investigation, the system helps 
<strong>protect customers, reduce financial risk, and strengthen internal fraud monitoring processes</strong>.
</p>

<h2>3. Key Analytical Focus</h2>

<h3>Engagement Analysis</h3>
<p>
FinTech Solutions Inc. needed a <strong>structured approach to detect potentially fraudulent transactions</strong> as quickly as possible. 
With growing transaction volumes and more diverse customer accounts, identifying high-risk activity manually was slow and prone to error.
</p>
<p>
This analysis focused on leveraging <strong>transactional and customer profile data</strong> to:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Detect unusual or high-risk transactions</strong> using multiple rule-based checks.</li>
    <li><strong>Assign a fraud score</strong> to each transaction to indicate its risk level (Medium, High, Very High).</li>
    <li><strong>Generate a consolidated fraud alert table</strong> to guide further investigations by the fraud team.</li>
    <li><strong>Enable timely reporting</strong> for regulatory compliance, including the preparation of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
By focusing on these areas, the analysis helped the company <strong>proactively flag suspicious transactions, minimize customer impact, and strengthen internal fraud monitoring</strong>.
