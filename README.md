  <h2>1. Client Background</h2>
  <p><strong>Client:</strong> FinTech Solutions Inc.</p>
  <p>
    FinTech Solutions Inc. is a U.S.-based fintech that provides digital payment and
    card transaction services across multiple states. As transaction volumes grew
    and customer accounts diversified, the company needed a clearer way to spot
    transactions that could indicate fraud.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the company had large volumes of transaction and customer data, there
    was no consistent process to turn that data into <strong>actionable fraud alerts</strong>
    for investigators and compliance teams. The goal was to build a system that
    proactively flags high-risk activity and supports <strong>Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)</strong>.

  <h2>2. Business Problem Statement</h2>

  <p>
    As transaction activity increased, FinTech Solutions Inc. faced growing exposure
    to potential fraud across its card payment platform. Fraud analysts were required
    to review large volumes of transactions, many of which posed little or no actual risk,
    making investigations time-consuming and inefficient.
  </p>

  <p>
    The absence of a structured fraud alerting framework made it difficult to
    consistently identify which transactions required immediate attention. Without
    clear prioritization, high-risk transactions could be reviewed too late, while
    analyst effort was spent on low-risk activity.
  </p>

  <p>
    The business needed a practical, data-driven approach that could:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Flag suspicious transactions using well-defined rules</li>
    <li>Prioritize alerts based on risk level</li>
    <li>Support timely investigations and regulatory reporting (SARs)</li>
  </ul>
